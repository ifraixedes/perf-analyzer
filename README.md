# Perf Analyzers

This is a hacky command-line tool for analyzing performance data from several file formats.

I initially created to analyze performance of the [Storj cloud storage](https://storj.io/).

__NOTE__:
- This is a work in progress.
- This is not an official [Storj Labs](https://storj.io/) project.
